# About Me

Hi, I'm Luis Quiñones, as a developer I have a deep appreciation for the art and science of programming. I've dabbled in various programming paradigms,
exploring their unique features and applications. I appreciate the impact that diversity in every way has in our existence, it allows us
to constantly innovate and then create a better future.

I'm currently interested in **LLM's**, **graphics programming** and **cloud computing** but really in how everything's almost totally [wired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xeGE_5kSI0).

Some things you might expect to be familiar with are: Go, NixOS, Rust, OCaml, AWS, JavaScript, Python and etcétera.
