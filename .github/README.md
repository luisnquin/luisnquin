Hey

I'm a software developer, some topics I'm interested for are:
- [Go](https://go.dev/)
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Nix & NixOS](https://nixos.org/) ecosystems
- [Biological Enginnering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering)
- [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
- [Cloud Computing](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud)
- [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)

In the open-source community, I've contributed to projects that resonate with my passions, including [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and [Home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
