Hi

As a software developer, some topics I'm interested for are:

- [Go](https://go.dev/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) ecosystems
- [Nix & NixOS](https://nixos.org/)
- [User interfaces based on text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
- [Biological Enginnering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering)
- [Functional Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
- [Cloud Computing](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud)
- [Free Software](https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software)

In FOSS, I've contributed to projects that resonate with my passions, including [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) and [Home manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
