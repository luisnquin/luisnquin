**Hi!** I am currently a **Software Developer**.

At FOSS, I only contribute to projects that I actively use at work or system and that resonate with my interests. Mostly
projects like [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), [encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore)
and some more related to my work(if possible!).

If you want to find more information about me you can [go here](https://quinones.pro) or write me at [luis@quinones.pro](mailto:luis@quinones.pro).
