Hello, my name is Luis Qui√±ones and I am currently a **Software Developer** and I'm currently working in multiple projects like [@QOMPAIO](https://qompa.io/), [@INVERSIONESIO](https://inversiones.io) and [@Chanchita](https://chanchita.app). If you want to find more information about me you can [go here](https://quinones.pro).

At FOSS, I only contribute to projects that I actively use at work or system and that resonate with my interests. Mostly projects like [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs), [encoredev/encore](https://github.com/encoredev/encore) and some more related to my work(if possible).
